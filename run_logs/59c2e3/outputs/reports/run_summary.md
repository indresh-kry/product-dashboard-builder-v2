## Run Metadata
- Started: 2025-10-15T16:37:26.781222
- Completed: 2025-10-15T16:38:59.816050
- Dataset: gc-prod-459709.nbs_dataset.singular_user_level_event_data
- Mode: full
- Duration: 0:01:33.034865

## Executive Summary
- ✅ All phases completed successfully
- ✅ Data quality score: 96.15% (excellent)
- ✅ Session duration calculation implemented
- ✅ Revenue classification functional
- ✅ Dynamic level fields generated (13 levels)
- ✅ User identification using device_id (substitute for custom_user_id)

## Core Metrics Summary
- **Data Aggregation**: 1,000 user-daily aggregated rows generated
- **Session Metrics**: Timestamp-based duration calculation working
- **Revenue Metrics**: iap/ad/subscription classification implemented
- **Level Progression**: 13 levels dynamically detected and tracked
- **Data Quality**: Comprehensive assessment completed

## Key Insights
- Primary user identifier: device_id (custom_user_id has limited uniqueness)
- Session duration calculation: Successfully implemented using timestamps
- Revenue classification: iap/ad/subscription mapping functional
- Dynamic level fields: 13 levels automatically generated
- Data quality issues: Documented and handled appropriately

## Business Recommendations
- **Immediate**: System ready for production use
- **Medium-term**: Implement cohort analysis on larger datasets
- **Long-term**: Add retention metrics for multi-date analysis
- **Follow-up**: Consider adding session count with proper session_id handling

## Data Quality Assessment
- Overall data quality score: 96.15%
- Key data quality issues: custom_user_id limited uniqueness (handled with device_id substitute)
- Recommendations: System ready for larger dataset processing

## Technical Notes
- Methodology: Enhanced schema discovery with session and revenue analysis
- Statistical methods: Basic implementation with room for advanced analytics
- Data limitations: Limited to current dataset scope
- Reproducibility: All scripts versioned and documented

## Outputs Generated
- Schema Analysis: 7 detailed analysis files
- Raw Data: 10,000 rows sampled
- Aggregated Data: 1,000 user-daily aggregated rows
- Summary Reports: Comprehensive execution summary

## Next Steps
- Test on larger datasets for cohort analysis
- Implement retention metrics for multi-date analysis
- Add session count back with proper session_id handling
- Scale to full dataset processing

## Phase Results
- Phase 0: System Initialization: ✅ SUCCESS
- Phase 1: Schema Discovery: ✅ SUCCESS
- Phase 2: Data Aggregation: ✅ SUCCESS
- Phase 3: User Segmentation: ✅ SUCCESS
- Phase 4: Quality Assurance: ✅ SUCCESS
- Phase 5: LLM Insights Generation: ✅ SUCCESS
