## Purpose

These documents serve as the foundational guidelines for:

- **Development Standards**: How to structure code, organize files, and follow patterns
- **System Architecture**: Understanding the overall system design and components
- **Data Processing**: How data flows through the system and gets aggregated
- **Quality Assurance**: Standards for statistical rigor and data quality
- **Workflow Execution**: How the analysis workflow operates end-to-end

## Usage

- **For Developers**: Reference these documents when implementing new features or scripts
- **For Analysts**: Understand the data structure and analysis methodology
- **For Project Managers**: Review system capabilities and implementation roadmap
- **For New Team Members**: Get up to speed on system architecture and standards

## Maintenance

These documents should be updated when:
- New components are added to the system
- Workflow processes change
- Data structure requirements evolve
- New standards or patterns are established
