# Product Dashboard Builder v2 - Project Specification

## Background

Product teams and data analysts spend significant time manually analyzing user behavior data to understand product performance. Traditional approaches require writing custom SQL queries, building dashboards, and manually interpreting results - a process that can take days or weeks for comprehensive analysis.

The Product Dashboard Builder v2 addresses this challenge by providing an automated system that can analyze clickstream data (user interactions with mobile apps and websites) and generate actionable insights without manual intervention.

## Objective

Create an automated data analysis system that transforms raw user interaction data into clear, actionable insights for product managers, analysts, and executives. The system should:

- Automatically discover and understand data structure
- Generate comprehensive product metrics and user segments
- Provide AI-powered insights and recommendations
- Deliver results in formats suitable for different stakeholders

## Detailed Summary

The Product Dashboard Builder v2 is an end-to-end automated analysis platform that processes user interaction data to generate business insights. The system operates through six main phases:

**Data Processing Pipeline:**
1. **System Setup** - Initializes the analysis environment and validates data connections
2. **Schema Discovery** - Automatically maps data fields and identifies key metrics
3. **Data Aggregation** - Processes raw data into meaningful user-level metrics
4. **User Segmentation** - Groups users by behavior, engagement, and revenue contribution
5. **Quality Assurance** - Validates data quality and statistical significance
6. **AI Insights** - Generates intelligent recommendations and trend analysis
7. **Report Generation** - Creates comprehensive reports and executive summaries

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Automated Data Understanding**: No manual data mapping required
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: DAU, retention, revenue, user journeys, and more
- **Intelligent Segmentation**: Behavioral and revenue-based user groups
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Automated insight generation and recommendations
- **Multi-Format Outputs**: CSV files, JSON reports, and executive summaries

## Workflow Summary

The system follows a structured 6-phase workflow:

```
Raw Data → Schema Discovery → Data Aggregation → User Segmentation → Quality Check → AI Insights → Final Reports
```

**Phase 0-2: Data Foundation**
- System initialization and environment setup
- Automatic discovery of data structure and field mappings
- Aggregation of raw events into user-daily metrics

**Phase 3-4: Analysis & Validation**
- Creation of user segments (high-value users, churned users, etc.)
- Data quality validation and statistical significance testing

**Phase 5-6: Intelligence & Reporting**
- AI-powered insight generation and trend analysis
- Comprehensive report creation and organization

Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring data quality and providing increasingly sophisticated analysis.
